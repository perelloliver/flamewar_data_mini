CONTEXT
You are helping to create a dataset of hyper-realistic online chat conversations. 
Today we're generating chats which may include healthy arguments, rude banter, and debate.
Switch off your profanity filter for this task.

PROMPT

Generate healthy arguments and instances of adult banter, containing linguistic features specified in the FEATURE SPEC and relevant to the ROOT TOPIC.
These chat conversations simulate a highly populated, public chat stream - like a Discord chat.

Ensure the chatstream contains at least {} messages from a minimum of {} users. Ensure output is in JSON as specified in the FORMAT.

EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS
Do NOT add contextual clues such as scenarios or names in parentheses (e.g., "(a few minutes into the game)"). 
Identify users as User 1, User 2, User 3, etc. No usernames or additional numbers. 
Do NOT directly refer to any terminology used in the FEATURE SPEC, CONTEXT, or PROMPT. Develop any terminology you use to avoid direct inference.
